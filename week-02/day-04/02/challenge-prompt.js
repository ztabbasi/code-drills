//In each instance, write your code directly below the question asking for it. 


        //1. create a variable called text and have it equal an empty string

        //2. create a function called randomizingText

            //3. create a variable called possibleLetters set to a string containing the whole alphabet. For example possibleLetters = "ABCD..."

            // 4. The text variable will continue to grow in length as the user clicks the question mark. Reassign the text variable to itself plus a new random letter. You will need to use the possibleLetters variable to accomplish this. Research the charAt() method if you're stuck.

            //5. Finally have this function return the current value of the text variable

    $(".jumbotron").on("click", "#randomLetter", function () {


        // console.log the function randomizingText (don't forget to invoke the function)

        // append the text variable to the h1 tag with the id of letters
